# AGENTS.md

## Setup commands
- Install deps: Install the latest Android Command Line Tools, then the Android SDK.

## Code style
- Modern, fluent.
- Comments on classes and functions when the name doesn't fully describe the use. Comments should explicitly state the "separation of concerns" and why the given chunk of code exists independently.

## Testing
- All code must compile.
- Tests should run, but may not always be possible on an emulator or without an active back-end.
